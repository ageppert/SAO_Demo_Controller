A Microcontroller for your smarter-than-average SAO!

The SAO Demo Controller makes it convenient to bring life to your advanced I2C-based SAO! Use this to test and demonstrate your new design even when your host badge isn't ready to control the SAO.

CAUTION: Do not plug this into your host badge and USB-C at the same time!!!
